    """Class for the post-processing of results derived from raw signals.

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    results : dict
    -   A dictionary containing results to process.
    -   The entries in the dictionary should be either lists, numpy arrays, or
        dictionaries.
    -   Entries which are dictionaries will have their values treated as being
        identical for all values in the 'results' dictionary, given they are
        extracted from these dictionaries into the results.
    -   Keys ending with "_dimensions" are treated as containing information
        about the dimensions of other attributes in the results, e.g.
        'X_dimensions' would specify the dimensions for attribute 'X'. The
        dimensions should be a list of strings containing the values "channels"
        and "frequencies" in the positions corresponding to the axis of these
        dimensions in 'X'. A single list should be given, i.e. 'X_dimensions'
        should hold for all entries of 'X'.If no dimensions, are given, the 0th
        axis is assumed to correspond to channels and the 1st axis to
        frequencies.
    -   E.g. if 'X' has shape [25, 10, 50, 300] with an 'X_dimensions' of
        ['epochs', 'channels', 'frequencies', 'timepoints'], the shape of 'X'
        would be rearranged to [10, 50, 25, 300], corresponding to the
        dimensions ["channels", "frequencies", "epochs", "timepoints"].

    extract_from_dicts : dict[list[str]] | None; default None
    -   The entries of dictionaries within 'results' to include in the
        processing.
    -   Entries which are extracted are treated as being identical for all
        values in the 'results' dictionary.

    identical_entries : list[str] | None; default None
    -   The entries in 'results' which are identical across channels and for
        which only one copy is present.
    -   If any dimension attributes are present, these should be included as an
        identical entry, as they will be added automatically.

    discard_entries : list[str] | None; default None
    -   The entries which should be discarded immediately without processing.

    freq_bands : dict | None; default None
    -   Dictionary containing the frequency bands whose results should also be
        calculated.
    -   Each key is the name of the frequency band, and each value is a list of
        numbers representing the lower- and upper-most boundaries of the
        frequency band, respectively, in the frequency units present in the
        results.

    METHODS
    -------
    average
    -   Averages results.

    subtract
    -   Subtracts results.

    append
    -   Appends other dictionaries of results to the list of result dictionaries
        stored in the PostProcess object.

    merge
    -   Merge dictionaries of results containing different keys into the
        results.
