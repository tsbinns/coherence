"""Methods for performing MATLAB-equivalent functions in Python.

METHODS
-------
mrdivide
-   Performs a matrix right division, equivalent to the 'mrdivide' function or
    '/' operator in MATLAB.

reshape
-   Equivalent to the MATLAB 'reshape' function, whereby the elements from the
    first axis onwards are taken in some order for the reshaping (i.e. from axis
    0 to n).

kron
-   Equivalent to the MATLAB 'kron' function, in which the Kronecker product is
    calculated.

def linsolve_transa(A: NDArray, B: NDArray) -> NDArray:
    """Equivalent of calling MATLAB's 'linsolve' function with the 'TRANSA'
    option set to 'True', whereby instead of solving the equation A*X=B, the
    equation A'*X=B is solved (where ' is the complex conjugate transposed).

    This is implemented in Python by calling scipy's 'linalg.solve' function
    with 'transposed' set to 'True'.

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    A : numpy array
    -   Variable A in the equation to solve.

    B : numpy array
    -   Variable B in the equation to solve.

    RETURNS
    -------
    numpy array
    -   Variable X in the equation to solve.

    """Equivalent to the MATLAB 'reshape' function, whereby the elements from
    the first axis onwards are taken in some order for the reshaping (i.e. from
    axis 0 to n).
    -   This is different to numpy's method of taking elements from the last
        axis first, then the penultimate axis, and so on (i.e. from axis n to
        0).

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    array : numpy array
    -   Array which will be reshaped.

    dims : int | tuple[int]
    -   The dimensions of the reshaped array.

    RETURNS
    -------
    numpy array
    -   The reshaped array.

    NOTES
    -----
    -   This is equivalent to calling numpy.reshape(array, order="F").

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    A : numpy array
    -   A matrix.

    B : numpy array
    -   A matrix.

    RETURNS
    -------
    K : numpy array
    -   The Kronecker product of 'A' and 'B'.

    NOTES
    -----
    -   If the matrices are not sparse, the numpy 'kron' function is used. If
        either of the matrices are sparse, the scipy.sparse function 'kron' is
        used.
