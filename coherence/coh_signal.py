    """Class for loading, preprocessing, and epoching an mne.io.Raw object.

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    verbose : bool; default True
    -   Whether or not to print information about the information processing.

    METHODS
    -------
    order_channels
    -   Orders channels in the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs object based on a
        given order.

    get_coordinates
    -   Extracts coordinates of the channels from the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs
        object.

    set_coordinates
    -   Assigns coordinates to the channels in the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs
        object.

    get_data
    -   Extracts the data array from the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs object,
        excluding data based on the annotations.

    load_raw
    -   Loads an mne.io.Raw object, loads it into memory, and sets it as the
        data, also assigning rereferencing types in 'extra_info' for the
        channels present in the mne.io.Raw object to 'none'.

    load_annotations
    -   Loads annotations corresponding to the mne.io.Raw object.

    pick_channels
    -   Retains only certain channels in the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs object,
        also retaining only entries for these channels from the 'extra_info'.

    bandpass_filter
    -   Bandpass filters the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs object.

    notch_filter
    -   Notch filters the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs object.

    resample
    -   Resamples the mne.io.Raw or mne.Epochs object.

    drop_unrereferenced_channels
    -   Drops channels that have not been rereferenced from the mne.io.Raw or
        mne.Epochs object, also discarding entries for these channels from
        'extra_info'.

    rereference_bipolar
    -   Bipolar rereferences channels in the mne.io.Raw object.

    rereference_CAR
    -   Common-average rereferences channels in the mne.io.Raw object.

    rereference_pseudo
    -   Pseudo rereferences channels in the mne.io.Raw object.
    -   This allows e.g. rereferencing types, channel coordinates, etc... to be
        assigned to the channels without any rereferencing occuring.
    -   This is useful if e.g. the channels were already hardware rereferenced.

    epoch
    -   Divides the mne.io.Raw object into epochs of a specified duration.
