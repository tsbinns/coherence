# Coherence

A repository containing code for my PhD project in the [Interventional and Cognitive Neuromodulation group](https://www.icneuromodulation.org/) of Wolf-Julian Neumann in the Movement Disorders unit of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, part of the [ReTune CRC](https://sfb-retune.de/).

The goal of the project is to examine the interaction between the cortex and basal ganglia using recordings of cortical ECoG and subthalamic LFP activity taken from the externalised leads of Parkinson's disease patients who have undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation. For a look at some preliminary results, please see the [publications page of my website](https://tsbinns.com/publications) for research posters on this topic.

The code expects data to be in the [BIDS format](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/), and relies heavily on the [MNE toolbox](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) for Python. **This remains a work-in-progress, and detailed instructions for how others may use this code will be provided at a later stage of development.**
